## Introduction

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual coding challenge where participants solve daily puzzles in the form of programming problems. This repository serves as a record of my solutions for the challenges presented in the year 2023.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized with the following folder structure:


  - **[day]/**
      - `input.txt` - text file containing the input for question.
      - `solution.ipynb` - Polyglot Jupyter notebook containing the solutions and explanations.

## Polyglot Notebook

To provide a more interactive and educational experience, I am using a Jupyter notebook (`solution.ipynb`) that includes not only the C# code but also explanations, visualizations, and potentially solutions in other programming languages.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/masterchief222/AOC-2023.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the day and part you are interested in.

3. Explore the C# solution in the polyglot notebook.



Happy coding! ðŸš€
